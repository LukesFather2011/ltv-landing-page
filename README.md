A project in The Odin Project curriculum. I am creating it around my Limitless TrueVibe brand.

I really learned a lot more about HTML and CSS than I though that I was retaining. It's almost like second nature now,
making an HTML documuemnt, and being able to reference elements, classes, or IDs to achieve styling that I want. Yes,
Of course it still takes time, and I have to look things up, but I really do believe this is part of the process. Now, 
on to Javascript!
